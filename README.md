# case-study

This program uses Python 3.6. You need pandas and matplotlib to run it.
To install the required modules, enter "pip install -r requirements.txt" and run the case_study.py with "python case_study.py".

If you are having trouble running it and you have two versions of Python in your system (versions 2 and 3), enter "pip3 install -r requirements.txt" instead and run the program using "python3 case_study.py".
